    <h1>Arrival to Park</h1>
    <p>The dog makes it to the park and plays with the other dogs. I talk to the other owner to let the dog have his fun. The dogs seems to be getting along with the other pretty well but he seems to be scared of some. He running around alot from the others but it seems like I shoudnt worry.</p>
